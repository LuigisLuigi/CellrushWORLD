# disclaimer: this is a project im doing for fun. 

im trying to see if i can "recreate" fnaf world in a month (or until the end of my college semester 12/14/24). I started this on the 15th of october so I will try to be done on the 15th of november.

## so about that...
yeah so college was kicking my ass so i had to stop and then i was going to continue this during my winter break but then my pc broke and other shit happened so i had to pause it even longer until NOW. i will be continuing this but idk if i will try and do the "one month" challenge, i just wanna finish the whole thing and have fun at my own slow ass snail pase. forgive me slimes üôè

note: do **NOT** flame me for the animations im mainly ignoring those for now and focusing on the actual code and scripts

oh also, idc what people do with this project, if you wanna fork it you can idc.
